# Composite-Web-App
Designing microstructure of composites using deep learning models.
Predictive and Generative neural networks are trained using FEA simulations to predict the properites and generate the microstructure of composite based on the input constraints.
Flask framework is used with Gunicorn WSGI HTTP server to implement the model on web, which then trains the model live on web.
