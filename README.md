# Composite-Web-App
Designing microstructure of composites using deep learning models. <br /> 
Predictive and Generative neural networks are trained using FEA simulations to predict the properites and generate the microstructure of composite based on the input constraints. <br /> 
Flask framework is used with Gunicorn WSGI HTTP server to implement the model on web, which then trains the model live on web.
